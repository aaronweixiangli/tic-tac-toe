## üìù Description
Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game in which players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with X's and O's. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game. If all of the spaces on the grid are filled without a player achieving three in a row, the game is a draw.

## üéØ How to Win 
To win the game, a player needs to place their symbol in three consecutive spaces on the grid, either in a row, column, or diagonal. For example, if a player places their symbol in the top-left, middle-left, and bottom-left spaces of a column, they win the game.
